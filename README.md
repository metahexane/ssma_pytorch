# Self-Supervised Model Adaptation for Multimodal Semantic Segmentation in PyTorch
This repository contains a PyTorch reproduction of the paper by [Valada et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03833). The authors provided their code [in Tensorflow](https://github.com/DeepSceneSeg/SSMA). The code provided in this repository, however, is an indepenent reproduction of their paper.

The program can be started with python main.py.
The help argument (-h/--help) may be used to extract detailed information about the parameters of the model.

Default parameters may be found in util/parser.py.
